    <h2>2020 Internship: R&D Clinical Development Intern @ Horizon Therapeutics</h2>
    <p> As I was tasked with validating these low activity levels, I immediately focused on numerical measurements through electronic capture: measurements from wearable accelerometer devices. Such computerized measurements are what came to mind when I thought of data analysis. However as I immersed myself in FDA guidelines on the use of such devices and learned about their limitations (such as lack of technical training and limited access to monitors), I realized that one needs much more information to understand the full story of a patient’s activity reduction.<br><br>
        In addition to the accelerometer, I added the 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) to my study. It’s an important, validated measurement that assesses aerobic capacity. However, even with an additional form of measurement, I sensed that I still wasn’t capturing the patient’s full story: The 6MWT only measures activity in one setting in a single point in time.
        <br><br>To further understand the patient perspective, I created a questionnaire which asked patients to check off a list of comorbid illnesses and rank how those affect their activity in relation to ILD. Rather than drawing a conclusion based on a few measurements, this questionnaire was a valuable tool in gaining insight on the patient perspective, quality of life, and other factors that may reduce activity.</p>

    <p>-Project Summary: Enhance the onboarding experience of makers by bringing contextual how-to links directly into the product homepage.<br><br>-Problem Statement: Currently, the top pain point among new PowerApps Makers is getting started with the platform and finding relevant documentation. With the features we propose, we aim to address and improve upon this issue by providing deliberately placed how-to links and other accessible information. </p>
