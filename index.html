    <p> I am Amanda Rudolph and I am from Evanston, Illinois, however I am currently in Ann Arbor as I am a Junior at the University of Michigan. I am a student in the School of information going through the BSI program, which has 2 pathways of User Experience and Information Analysis. The program is best explained as being the intersection of information, technology and people as it provides the unique blending of strong technical aptitude with people & communication skills. While I have been taking classes in coding,statistics, information analysis, and User experience throughout this program, I am also concentrating in public health, where I have found that my data oriented perspective gives me a unique insight in the health field. Outside of my classes, I am very involved in the technology and design consulting organizations, Reach Consulting Group and CHISL where I am gaining real-world experience as I am helping companies with their UX/UI design, data analytics, and digital strategy needs while utilizing both my analytical and creative mindsets as well as service orgs such as Circle K where I have the Health & Wellness committee chair position. I also spend a lot of my free time spending time with friends and family, playing tennis, and trying new restaurants!</p>
